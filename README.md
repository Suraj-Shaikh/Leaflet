Summary
This script initializes four different Leaflet maps for different soil properties (landform, soil depth, soil AWC, soil OC). It provides dropdowns for selecting districts, talukas, and villages, dynamically updating the map layers based on these selections to show relevant GeoJSON data for each administrative level.
